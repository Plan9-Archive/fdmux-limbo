works, needs a review for races.


# intro

fdmux multiplexes a file descriptor, e.g. a tcp connection.  each
communication channel allows two-way communication and is accessed
as a normal file descriptor.  priority for file descriptors can be
set.


# install

make sure you have "util" installed.

change mkconfig if you do not have $ROOT set.  now "mk" to compile
and "mk install" to install the files.

when building from within inferno, insert SYSHOST=Inferno and ROOT=
in the mk invocations to override the values in the mkconfig.

# todo

- perhaps change way to connect/listen for connections.  e.g. by "port" number.
- there still seems to be a hang?
- find way to make this more elegant.
- have high/low water mark for sending win messages?  we send many now
- perhaps let open() and accept() return two fd's, one for writing and one for reading.
  and have protocol messages for hanging up one of the sides.
- think about a smarter way to deal with windows.  i.e. start with
  small one, then increase when bandwidth increases.
